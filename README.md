# Descriptions
The AlgoMed â€“ Computerized Pressure Algometer is the first software-based computerized Algometer to offer real-time visual & auditory feedback to control & monitor applied pressure rates.

Algometers are designed to quantify and document levels of tenderness via pressure threshold measurement and pain sensitivity via pain tolerance measurement. Pressure algometry is a reliable measure of pain in muscle, joints, tendons, and ligaments.

The challenge in performing algometry tests is to apply continuous pressure at a constant rate on the patient selected body site without having the possibility to monitor it in real time.
